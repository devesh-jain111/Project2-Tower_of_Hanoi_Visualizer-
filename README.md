# Project2-Tower_of_Hanoi_Visualizer-
The **Tower of Hanoi Visualizer** is a C++ console application that solves the Tower of Hanoi problem using recursion. It visually demonstrates the movement of disks between three towers through ASCII art. Users input the number of disks, and the program illustrates each move, enhancing understanding of this classic algorithmic challenge.
